This SQL query is used to extract data from a table called STATION. The query is designed
to find the smallest value of the Northern Latitude (LAT_N) column that is greater than a
specific latitude of 38.7780.

The query uses the WHERE clause to filter the data from the STATION table and returns only
the rows where the LAT_N value is greater than 38.7780.

The MIN function is used to find the smallest value of the filtered LAT_N values.

Finally, the ROUND function is used to round the resulting value to 4 decimal places, as
specified in the query.

Overall, this SQL query can be used to find the smallest Northern Latitude value that
meets a specific criteria, which may be useful in a variety of data analysis and reporting
scenarios.
