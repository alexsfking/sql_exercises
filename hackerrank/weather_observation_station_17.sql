***Chat-GPT***
This SQL code retrieves the Western Longitude (LONG_W) of the station in the database table named
"STATION" where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) is greater than 38.7780. The result is
rounded to 4 decimal places.

The code consists of the following parts:
    SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4): This part of the code selects the LONG_W column from the STATION table
    and rounds it to 4 decimal places.
    FROM STATION: This part of the code specifies the table from which the data will be retrieved.
    In this case, it is the STATION table.
    WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MIN(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N>38.7780): This part of the code
    specifies the condition for selecting the data from the STATION table. The condition is that
    the value of LAT_N should be the smallest among all the values greater than 38.7780. This
    condition is achieved using a subquery that retrieves the minimum value of LAT_N from the
    STATION table where the value of LAT_N is greater than 38.7780. The outer query then selects
    the LONG_W column from the STATION table where the condition specified in the subquery is
    satisfied.

Overall, the code retrieves the Western Longitude of the station in the STATION table where the Northern Latitude is the smallest among all values greater than 38.7780, and the result is rounded to 4 decimal places.
